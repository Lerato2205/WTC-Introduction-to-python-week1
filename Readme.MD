Week 1: Conditions â€“ recommendations.py
In this lesson, I learned how to use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to control the flow of a program based on user input.

The script asks the user to choose the difficulty level (Difficult or Casual) and the number of players (Multiplayer or Single-player). Based on their choices, it recommends a card game using a function called recommend().

I practiced using nested if statements, creating functions, and handling invalid input by printing error messages.

What I learned:

How to take input from the user using input()

How to use if, elif, and else for branching logic

How to call a function with a parameter

How to give useful feedback when the input is invalid
