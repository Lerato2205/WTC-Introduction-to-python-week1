Week 1: Conditions â€“ recommendations.py
In this lesson, I learned how to use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to control the flow of a program based on user input.

The script asks the user to choose the difficulty level (Difficult or Casual) and the number of players (Multiplayer or Single-player). Based on their choices, it recommends a card game using a function called recommend().

I practiced using nested if statements, creating functions, and handling invalid input by printing error messages.

What I learned:

How to take input from the user using input()

How to use if, elif, and else for branching logic

How to call a function with a parameter

How to give useful feedback when the input is invalid

n this lesson, I learned how to use if not to validate user input early in the program. By checking whether the input is not one of the expected values, I can give feedback and exit the function early using return. This helps avoid deeply nested conditions and keeps the main logic cleaner.

I also reinforced how to:

Use or inside if not (...) for validation

Simplify logic by removing unnecessary else blocks

Make the code more readable and robust
